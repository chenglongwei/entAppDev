How to execute this project?

1. Clone code: git clone https://github.com/chenglongwei/entAppDev.git

2. Import project: Open idea, choose *Import Project*, import the project

3. Set up JDK

4. Add lib dependencies, all are spring related (If you do not know, email me).

5. In GreetingMainApp, Run GreetingMain App

Some learning points:

1. Default scope of of bean is 'Singleton': state would share.

2. "ClassPathXmlApplicationContext" parameter, as is to say the path of bean.xml, starts from src.

3. This simple code can only *import* to idea, or else, you have to set up jdk and libs yourself.
